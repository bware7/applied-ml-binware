# Lab 2: Titanic Data Analysis

**Author:** Bin Ware  
**Date:** March 21, 2025  

## Overview
This project analyzes the Titanic dataset to explore passenger characteristics and survival patterns. It includes data inspection, exploration, cleaning, feature engineering, and splitting for machine learning, using Python with pandas, seaborn, matplotlib, and scikit-learn.

## Repository Structure
- `README.md`: Project overview and instructions.
- `ml02_binware.ipynb`: Jupyter Notebook with full analysis (code, outputs, reflections).
- No external data file (uses Seaborn's built-in Titanic dataset).

## Requirements
- Python 3.x
- Libraries: `pandas`, `seaborn`, `matplotlib`, `scikit-learn` 

## Usage
1. Open `ml02_binware.ipynb` in Jupyter Notebook or VS Code.
2. Run all cells to execute the analysis and view outputs/plots.
3. Review reflections for insights on data patterns and splitting methods.

## Key Sections
1. **Inspect Data**: Load and summarize Titanic dataset.
2. **Explore & Prepare**: Visualize patterns, clean data, engineer features.
3. **Feature Selection**: Choose predictors for survival.
4. **Splitting**: Compare basic vs. stratified train/test splits.

## Notes
- Outputs assume `random_state=123` for reproducibility.
- Reflections align with lab requirements and provided outputs.
